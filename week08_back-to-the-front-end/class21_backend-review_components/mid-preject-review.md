# Mid-project Review

* Middleware are functions run between request and response
* Try to pull useful code out into its own module
* Use the same variable naming convention (camelCase, snake_case, kabab-case) everywhere
  * usually in JavaScript we use camel case
* Make sure to not add extra white-space (spaces at the end of line)
  * turn on `Trim Final Newlines` and `Trim Trailing Whitespace`
