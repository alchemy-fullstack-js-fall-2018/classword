  * Project entry form
    - project name
    - description

    - checkbox for languages/tools used



Create a sample project submission form. This form should allow a user to enter the project name, a short description, a full (long) description, and featured image. The user should also be able to select the languages/frameworks/tools that were used. There should be a way to select if the project is a group or individual project.

You should also be continuing to work on your portfolio site!
